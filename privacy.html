      You can request information about what analytics data we store by contacting us at 
      <a href="mailto:7luxorbot@proton.me">7luxorbot@proton.me</a>. While we cannot allow individual users to opt out of analytics collection (as it is essential for service operation and security), we minimize the data collected to only whatâ€™s necessary.
    </p>

    <h2>Usage of Data</h2>
    <p>
      When a command is invoked, we store the message content for a maximum of 14 days for debugging purposes. We also store up to 18 entries for edited messages and sniping messages that expire in two hours or less in volatile memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, Guild IDs, Channel IDs, Role IDs, User IDs, and Message IDs are stored so that our system can aggregate data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nickname, Username, and Avatar changes are logged to enable the "namehistory" and "avatarhistory" commands. Users can clear this data themselves at any time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guild name changes are logged to enable the "gnames" command, and server administrators can clear this data themselves at any time.
    </p>

    <h2>Information Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell or expose your information to others, nor do we share it with any third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Removal</h2>
    <p>
      If you would like to request removal of your data from our active systems, please email us at 
      <a href="mailto:7luxorbot@proton.me">7luxorbot@proton.me</a>. Please note that while we honor deletion requests for our active systems, we may be unable to remove your data from existing backups until they naturally expire according to our retention schedule. Response times may vary and could take up to 7 days.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Storage and Backups</h2>
    <p>
      Our primary data storage is located in Dallas, Texas. For redundancy and disaster recovery, we maintain replicated backups in data centers located in New York, USA, and Falkenstein, Germany.
    </p>
    <p>
      Automated backups are performed every 8 hours (3 times daily) in the UTC timezone. These backups are retained for 7 days before being permanently deleted.
    </p>
